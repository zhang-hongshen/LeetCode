## Problem

> [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.cn/problems/course-schedule/)

 ## Thought Process

The problem can be converted into whether there is a topological sort in graph. If exist a pair between ith course and jth course, it's equal to a edge from ith node to jth node in graph.

We define three state of node. The first one is not visited, the second is searching which means its neighbor node haven't finished searching. The third one is done, which means searching is done.

## Code

### First Solution

**Complexity**

$n$ is num of course, $m$ is num of prerequisite 

- time complexity:   $O(n + m) $ 
- space complexity: $O(n + m)$

**Java**

```java
class Solution {

    List<List<Integer>> edges;
    int[] visited;
    boolean valid = true;

    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        edges = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            edges.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }
        for (int[] info : prerequisites) {
            edges.get(info[0]).add(info[1]);
        }
        visited = new int[numCourses];
        for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            if(0 == visited[i]){
                dfs(i);
            }
        }
        return valid;
    }

    public void dfs(int u){
        visited[u] = 1;
        for(int v: edges.get(u)){
            if(0 == visited[v]){
                dfs(v);
                if(!valid){
                    return;
                }
            } else if(1 == visited[v]){
                valid = false;
                return;
            }
        }
        visited[u] = 2;
    }
}
```
